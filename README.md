# Credit-Risk-Analysis-
The purpose of the project was to develop the model to predict the loan default probability issued by 
the bank to the borrowewrs. 
The dataset on credit defaults was taken from the book: Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling, 3rd Edition, 
The correlatio analysis and Modelling Amalysis is based on the coding practices learned 
during from Business Sceince university R-Track. 

1. Correlation analysis: 
In The first part of the analysis the data dicovery as a well as the correlation between predictors and the target was 
calculated to determine whether the features could be used to predict the probability 
of the defualt of the bank customers. 
As a result the feautures that have both considerable positive or negative correlation with defautlt metric 
were detected:
